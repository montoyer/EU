# ðŸ“„ Framework contracts

As an independent consultant, working directly with the Commission is not possible.

The EU institutions are using framework contracts.

A framework contract is a legally binding agreement between a buyer and a supplier that sets out the terms and conditions for the supply of goods or services over a certain period of time. It provides a framework for the buyer to place orders with the supplier and for the supplier to provide those goods or services. The terms of the framework contract may include things like pricing, delivery schedules, quality standards, and other conditions that apply to the orders placed under the contract. Framework contracts are often used by organizations, such as the European Commission, to streamline their procurement process and ensure a consistent level of quality and service from their suppliers. They can be used to cover a wide range of goods or services, including IT development services.
