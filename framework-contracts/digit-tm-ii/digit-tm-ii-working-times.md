# DIGIT TM II working times

Consultants in Times and Means are required to provide services during normal working hours (7 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time at the location of the customer) and should be available to provide services during specific time frames (9:30 a.m. to noon and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. local time at the location of the customer).

In exceptional cases, extended service hours may be requested by the customer. Any additional hours beyond the normal 8 hours that are not explicitly requested by the customer cannot be invoiced by the contractor. If additional hours are worked within normal working hours, they will be invoiced at a pro-rata of the applicable daily rate. If additional hours are worked outside of normal working hours, they will be invoiced at a pro-rata of the applicable daily rate with a 50% surcharge. The contractor is required to follow all applicable labor and social laws.
