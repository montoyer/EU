# DIGIT TM II delivery modes

The DIGIT-TM II contract is the European Commission's 1.1 billion euro contract for IT services throughout Europe. It will cover more than 2000 external IT service providers at the Commission.&#x20;

## Delivery modes and locations

There are three types of delivery modes under the contract: on-site, near-site, and far-site.

* On-site contracts require professionals to work at the Commission's office
* Near-site contracts allow for remote work within the same country as the Commission's office, or close by (2 hours notice)
* far-site contracts allow for remote work within the European Union.

The use of each type of delivery mode may vary among Directorates-General and may be subject to negotiation with the individual's direct management.
