# DIGIT TM II Scorecards

The scorecard is a tool used to assess the qualifications of external service providers who are being considered for a contract under the DIGIT-TM II framework. It consists of a list of minimum requirements for each profile and is used to determine the level of the proposed external service provider in the event that a specific contract is signed. The scorecard takes into account the total number of years of successful studies, the total number of years of relevant IT experience, specific expertise, and certifications and standards (for Lot 2 and Lot 3 only).

Each level corresponds to a minimum number of points, and the points obtained by the proposed external service provider will determine their level. The customer can specify the minimum and/or maximum level of experience and/or specific expertise needed for a particular task, and the contractor's offer must meet these requirements in order to be considered.

The scorecard is designed to allow for flexibility in terms of qualifications, allowing for a missing degree to be compensated for through years of experience and to a limited extent through expertise and/or certification/standards.

## Points for Education levels

| Lot | Minimum Educational Qualification                     | Score   |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1   | Level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework      | 6       |
| 2   | Level 6 or 7 of the European Qualifications Framework | 6 or 10 |
| 3   | Level 7 of the European Qualifications Framework      | 10      |

* Level of education corresponding to Level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework3 corresponds to a bachelor’s level or 3 years of higher education.
* Level of education corresponding to Level 7 of the European Qualifications Framework corresponds to a master’s level or 5 years of higher education.

## Points for Experience

Experience in the relevant IT field or other required experience detailed in the technical annex will be considered when evaluating the proposed external service providers. CVs of external service providers should demonstrate relevant experience as stated in the profile and request. Requests can specify either the minimum and/or maximum level or only the maximum level that the proposed external service provider should meet to be accepted, along with the associated score.

The number of years of professional experience in the relevant IT field can be compensated for through the other dimensions of the scorecard. Each year (equivalent to 12 months) of professional experience in the relevant IT field will earn 1 point, and the total number of points earned will be added to the points earned in the other dimensions to determine if the proposed external service provider meets the requirements and to assign a level. Only full years will be counted towards the points.

The maximum number of points that can be earned for professional experience in the relevant IT field is 20, equivalent to 20 years of experience. All relevant IT experience beyond 20 years will be scored at the maximum of 20 points.

## Points for Certificates and standards

For lots 2 and 3 only, having a certificate or standard is a minimum requirement for some profiles and will result in 1 point. For each additional certificate or standard the external service provider possesses, they will receive 1 additional point, up to a maximum of 3 points. If a required certificate or standard is not possessed, the CV will be rejected. In other cases, possessing a certificate or standard will result in bonus points and can compensate for missing years of education or professional experience, limited to 3 points under both lots 2 and 3. The total points obtained from certificates and standards will be added to the total score to determine the level of the external service provider.

| Number of certificates/standards | Points for Lot 2 and 3 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0                                | 0                      |
| 1                                | 1                      |
| 2                                | 2                      |
| 3                                | 3                      |
| >3                               | 3                      |

## Points for Specific expertise

For all lots except for level 0, points can be obtained for specific expertise in a technology or product based on the number of years of experience. One or two years of expertise earns 1 point, three years earns 2 points, and more than three years earns 3 points.

For all lots, the number of years of specific expertise in a specific technology or product determines the number of points earned as follows:

* 0 years of specific expertise: 0 points
* 1-2 years of specific expertise: 1 point
* 3 years of specific expertise: 2 points
* 4+ years of specific expertise: 3 points
