# THE EU KNOWLEDGE TEST

The application of EU knowledge testing is expected to be included in competitions like the AD5 generalist competition in 2024. The test format consists of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that focus on substantive topics such as treaty base, legislative procedures, institutional competencies, and key policies. The questions are based on universally accessible sources of information, and candidates will be informed about the specific sources used.&#x20;

It is advisable for candidates to familiarize themselves with EU terminology in their second language, as proficiency in the language may be assessed during interviews for those on the Reserve List.
