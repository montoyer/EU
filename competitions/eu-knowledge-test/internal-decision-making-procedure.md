# Internal decision-making procedure

The EU Commission employs four distinct internal decision-making procedures:

1. **Oral Procedure:** Decisions, ranging from political to economic matters, are made by the Commission during its regular or special meetings through discussions and verbal communication.
2. **Written Procedure:** This method is applied when Commissioners either do not express reservations or request alterations to a draft proposal within a specified timeframe. Decisions are then formalized in writing.
3. **Empowerment Procedure:** The Commission designates one or more of its members to handle a specific situation on its behalf. This procedure grants the appointed individuals the authority to act on behalf of the Commission in managing certain matters.
4. **Delegation Procedure:** In this procedure, the Commission delegates the authority to enact particular measures to directors-general or heads of service on behalf of the Institution. This approach allows for the efficient distribution of responsibilities within the Commission's organizational structure.
